# **Agentic AI Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a lightweight Agentic AI Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that runs entirely on a local system without relying on external APIs or cloud-based large language models. The chatbot integrates a compact yet powerful language model (phi3:mini) through Ollama and combines it with a vector database to enable intelligent, context-aware document understanding and response generation. By ingesting PDF documents, splitting them into meaningful chunks, generating embeddings using nomic-embed-text, and storing them in a Chroma vector database, the system can retrieve the most relevant information based on user queries and provide grounded, accurate responses.

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely only on pretrained knowledge, this system enhances response quality by dynamically retrieving document-specific context in real time. It incorporates agentic behavior through a tool-based reasoning framework, allowing the model to autonomously decide when to invoke a Document Search tool before answering. This demonstrates practical implementation of modern AI system design principles, including local LLM deployment, vector similarity search, intelligent retrieval mechanisms, and structured decision-making within a RAG pipeline. The architecture is optimized for efficiency and low-resource environments, making it suitable for academic projects, research applications, enterprise knowledge assistants, and privacy-focused AI solutions.
